                <p>In the field of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), accident prevention is not about luck; it's about systematic control. The foundation of this control rests on distinguishing and managing the two primary causes of incidents: the **Unsafe Act** and the **Unsafe Condition**. Developed through decades of safety research, these concepts provide a simple yet powerful framework for analyzing and preventing workplace incidents. A truly robust safety program must address both the human element and the environment.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion: The Path to Zero Harm</h3>
                <p>Achieving a 'Zero Harm' environment hinges on the continuous, proactive management of Unsafe Acts and Unsafe Conditions. It requires management commitment to fund necessary environmental fixes and a cultural commitment from every employee to follow safe procedures and speak up when they see a hazard. By fostering a culture where both physical hazards are promptly eliminated and safe behaviors are the norm, organizations can drastically reduce risk and protect their most valuable asset: their people.</p>
