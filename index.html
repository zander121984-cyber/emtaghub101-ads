            <section id="introduction">
                <p>In the field of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), accident 
                <a href="#prevention-methods">prevention is not about luck</a>; it's about systematic control. The 
                foundation of this control rests on distinguishing and managing the two 
                primary causes of incidents: the **<a href="#unsafe-act">Unsafe Act</a>** and the **<a href="#unsafe-condition">Unsafe Condition</a>**. Developed through decades of safety research, these 
                concepts provide a simple yet powerful framework for analyzing and 
                preventing workplace incidents. A truly robust safety program must 
                address both the human element and the environment.</p>

            <section id="unsafe-act">
                <h3>1. Unsafe Acts: The Human Factor (90% of Incidents)</h3>
                <p>An Unsafe Act is a deviation from standard operating procedure, an accepted practice, or common sense that could lead to an injury or incident. It is a direct result of human behavior and often accounts for the vast majority of incidents (historically cited as 88-96% by Heinrich's model, although modern science suggests a more complex interaction).</p>
                
                <h4>Examples of Unsafe Acts:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Ignoring Procedures:** Failure to follow Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) procedures.</li>
                    <li>**Improper Use of Tools:** Using a wrench as a hammer or lifting with the back instead of the legs.</li>
                    <li>**Distraction:** Using a mobile phone while operating machinery or driving a forklift.</li>
                    <li>**No PPE:** Operating a grinder without safety glasses.</li>
                    <li>**Horseplay:** Engaging in practical jokes or running in designated walking areas.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Mitigation strategies for Unsafe Acts focus heavily on **training, supervision, behavior-based safety (BBS) programs, and strong safety leadership.**</p>

                <h3>2. Unsafe Conditions: The Environmental Factor</h3>
                <p>An Unsafe Condition is any physical or environmental fault in the workplace that could cause an incident. It is the flaw in the environment, equipment, or process that, when combined with an Unsafe Act or simple bad luck, results in harm. These conditions require immediate reporting and engineering solutions, primarily using the Hierarchy of Controls.</p>
                
                <h4>Examples of Unsafe Conditions:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>**Defective Equipment:** Frayed wiring on a power tool or a cracked ladder rung.</li>
                    <li>**Poor Housekeeping:** Spills not cleaned up or boxes blocking emergency exits.</li>
                    <li>**Inadequate Guarding:** Missing machine guards or barriers around exposed pits.</li>
                    <li>**Ventilation:** Insufficient airflow leading to the buildup of toxic fumes.</li>
                    <li>**Lack of Warning Systems:** Missing caution tape or non-functioning smoke detectors.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Mitigation for Unsafe Conditions relies on regular **inspections, preventative maintenance, engineering controls, and robust hazard identification systems** (like EMTAG Hub's tagging protocols).</p>

                <h3>Conclusion: The Path to Zero Harm</h3>
                <p>Achieving a 'Zero Harm' environment hinges on the continuous, proactive management of Unsafe Acts and Unsafe Conditions. It requires management commitment to fund necessary environmental fixes and a cultural commitment from every employee to follow safe procedures and speak up when they see a hazard. By fostering a culture where both physical hazards are promptly eliminated and safe behaviors are the norm, organizations can drastically reduce risk and protect their most valuable asset: their people.</p>
